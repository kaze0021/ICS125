# MentalZots
A Mental Health wellness app made for UCI's CS 125

## Motivation
Due to high workloads, students often forgo basic needs or forget to take care of themselves. As young adults, mental and physical health is important to maintain in order to foster a healthy future and limit the risk of problems. Poor mental health can also negatively affect general activities in life. Dehydration can cause severe health issues and be a detriment to academic success. A lack of sleep can induce brain fog, stress, and enhance negative feelings. A lack of physical exercise has been linked to an increase in depression. It’s important for students to take a step back and relax as neglecting their physical health will have a serious detriment to their mental health. This all leads to a decrease in productivity and efficiency potentially creating a negative loop of declining health and motivation. 
## Solution
Currently, there are apps such as sleep tracker where users can input their sleep hours for the day. There are similar separate apps for exercise and hydration. These apps help track one’s particular habits but don’t provide recommendations or suggestions on how to improve one’s current and personal lifestyle if they feel that they need to improve. These apps mostly take into consideration what the user wants but not what is recommended for them based on age and gender from research. It is also not efficient for the user to deal with multiple apps to track sleep, hydration, and exercise for mental health. We track that all within our app at once and generate personalized recommendations through data and our calculations for users to incorporate in their lives and track the difference every fourteen days to see if the improvements are working.
